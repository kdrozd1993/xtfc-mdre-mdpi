# XTFC MDRE MDPI

## Description
This repository includes the code for the MDPI Mathematics paper Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Functional Interpolation for Solving the Matrix Differential Riccati Equation. The scripts used to generate the results are found in the Trials\Fifth_Order_Fluid_Catalytic_Reactor directory.

## Installation
This code was run with MATLAB 2021a. The open source MATLAB Automatic Differentiation tool ADiGator (https://sourceforge.net/projects/adigator/) is used to compute Jacobains. This code is provided in the JacobianAndLeastSquares directory. The script startupadigator must be run prior to using it. All other codes were written by Kristofer Drozd, except for the ODE solvers in the OdeSolvers directory.

## Support
If any users need help running the code they can send an email to kdrozd@arizona.edu.

## Authors and acknowledgment
The main author for this project is Kristofer Drozd, but he would like to awknowledge Enrico Schiassi, Mario de Florio, Andrea D'Ambrosio, and Roberto Furfaro for their guidance and support.
